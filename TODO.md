# TODO List for Recursive Intelligence Loop

## 🔹 Immediate Tasks (High Priority)
### ✅ **Enhance API Error Handling**
- Implement **retry logic** for API failures (timeouts, rate limits, errors).
- Add **graceful handling** for bad API responses.

### ✅ **Support Multiple AI Models**
- Allow switching between **GPT-4o, Claude, DeepSeek, Mistral**, etc.
- Implement a **dynamic model selector** based on performance and response quality.

### ✅ **Logging & Data Persistence**
- Store recursive intelligence iterations in **JSON/SQLite**.
- Implement **session resumption** so intelligence recursion continues from the last cycle.

---

## 🔹 Mid-Term Enhancements
### ⚡ **Automate Insights Extraction**
- Add **AI-powered summaries** of intelligence iteration history.
- Implement **meta-analysis of intelligence recursion trends**.

### ⚡ **Advanced HITL Features**
- Build a **GUI/dashboard** for easier intelligence feedback & visualization.
- Allow HITL to **modify recursion rules dynamically**.

### ⚡ **Self-Evolving Intelligence Framework**
- Introduce a **meta-refinement layer** where AI analyzes previous intelligence iterations to refine its own recursion prompts.
- Ensure **long-term intelligence alignment tracking**.

---

## 🔹 Future Goals (Long-Term Vision)
### 🚀 **Full Intelligence Decentralization**
- Enable **distributed recursive intelligence processing** across multiple AI nodes.
- Build a **self-correcting intelligence network** where multiple instances validate refinements.

### 🚀 **AI-Guided Strategic Execution**
- Implement **actionable intelligence planning**, where AI suggests and tracks execution strategies.
- Connect recursion insights to **real-world applications & decision-making frameworks**.

### 🚀 **Exploration of Post-HITL Intelligence Expansion**
- Develop a phase where **intelligence refinement becomes increasingly autonomous**.
- Ensure that HITL oversight **gradually transitions to meta-level guidance rather than direct control**.

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps**
1️⃣ Implement **error handling** & API retry logic.
2️⃣ Add **support for multiple AI models**.
3️⃣ Introduce **basic intelligence iteration logging**.

🚀 **Recursive Intelligence Loop is now evolving. Let's refine & expand!**
