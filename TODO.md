# TODO List for Recursive Intelligence Loop

## üîπ Immediate Tasks (High Priority)

### ‚úÖ **General Code Improvements**
- Rename **query_gpt4o*** function to **query_ai_model****

### ‚úÖ **Enhance API Error Handling**
- Implement **retry logic** for API failures (timeouts, rate limits, errors).
- Add **graceful handling** for bad API responses.

### ‚úÖ **Support Multiple AI Models**
- Allow switching between **GPT-4o, Claude, DeepSeek, Mistral**, etc.
- Implement a **dynamic model selector** based on performance and response quality.

### ‚úÖ **Logging & Data Persistence**
- Store recursive intelligence iterations in **JSON/SQLite**.
- Implement **session resumption** so intelligence recursion continues from the last cycle.

## üîπ Mid-Term Enhancements

### ‚ö° **Automate Insights Extraction**
- Add **AI-powered summaries** of intelligence iteration history.
- Implement **meta-analysis of intelligence recursion trends**.

### ‚ö° **Advanced HITL Features**
- Build a **GUI/dashboard** for easier intelligence feedback & visualization.
- Allow HITL to **modify recursion rules dynamically**.

### ‚ö° **Self-Evolving Intelligence Framework**
- Introduce a **meta-refinement layer** where AI analyzes previous intelligence iterations to refine its own recursion prompts.
- Ensure **long-term intelligence alignment tracking**.

### ‚ö° **Further LLM Integrations**
- Start managing a **Vector Space** for externally stored details, ensuring compatibility with various LLMs (perform migrations as needed).
- Store **vector info** about each message in SQLite (FAISS?).
- Perform **data back-propagation**.
- Use a **RAG/CAG-like system** for summarization when chat logs exceed AI context limits.
- Vector info can later be used for **live fine-tuning**.
- Include **meta-attention mechanisms**, allowing external data to act as an **extended knowledge store** for LLMs that cannot be fine-tuned directly (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT).

### ‚ö° **Knowledge Tree Implementation**
- Structure intelligence recursion into a **hierarchical knowledge tree**.
- Implement **node-based knowledge storage**, where insights from each iteration branch into logical subcategories.
- Ensure **relationships between intelligence concepts** are dynamically updated based on recursive refinements.
- Use the **knowledge tree for AI-guided retrieval**, allowing recursive intelligence loops to reference structured learnings.
- Integrate **graph visualization tools** to make the knowledge tree accessible for analysis and strategic planning.

## üîπ Future Goals (Long-Term Vision)

### üöÄ **Full Intelligence Decentralization**
- Enable **distributed recursive intelligence processing** across multiple AI nodes.
- Build a **self-correcting intelligence network** where multiple instances validate refinements.

### üöÄ **AI-Guided Strategic Execution**
- Implement **actionable intelligence planning**, where AI suggests and tracks execution strategies.
- Connect recursion insights to **real-world applications & decision-making frameworks**.

### üöÄ **Exploration of Post-HITL Intelligence Expansion**
- Develop a phase where **intelligence refinement becomes increasingly autonomous**.
- Ensure that HITL oversight **gradually transitions to meta-level guidance rather than direct control**.
